		Darmaan Khaali Carwo herself, requested a sporting revolver from Trappiste. \
		What was delivered wasn't a target revolver, it was a target crusher. The \
		weapon became popular as Carwo crushed many shooting competitions using \
		the Takbok, with the design going on several production runs up until \
		2511 when the popularity of the gun fell off. Due to the number of revolvers \
		made, they are still easy enough to find if you look despite production \
		having already ceased many years ago."
